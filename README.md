## ðŸ“Š Goal: 
Create a two player Tic-Tac-Toe game. The users should be able to click to place their X or O and if they win the program should mention their win in the DOM. 

## ðŸ“Š How it's made: 
This game was made using HTML, CSS and Javascript with as much object-oriented programming as I could code with very little knowledge or experience. This is also a mobile, tablet, and desktop responsive game.

## ðŸ“Š Lesson Learned: 
Working patiently and at a slow speed is ideal for me, especially with new material. It helps me absorb things easier. Once I get the hang of something though, I like to work hard and quick. But I've learned to give myself a lot of grace and all the time I need, and trust that I will get it done with enough determination. I think and learn slowly and quietly at first, but I've learned that that isn't a bad thing. I was able to avoid some major mistakes while writing this code, and even finished the assignment a lot earlier than my goal intended me to, so I know I'm growing and getting better.
